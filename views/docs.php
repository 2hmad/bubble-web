                <p>
                    Bubble is both designer and developer friendly by sticking to PHP's principles and adding functionality useful for templating environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bubble is used by Open-Source projects and frameworks like DinoPHP â€” just to name a few.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast: Bubble compiles templates down to plain optimized PHP code. The overhead compared to regular PHP code was reduced to the very minimum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secure: Bubble has a sandbox mode to evaluate untrusted template code. This allows Bubble to be used as a template language for applications where users may modify the template design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flexible: Bubble is powered by a flexible lexer and parser. This allows the developer to define their own custom tags and filters, and to create their own DSL.
